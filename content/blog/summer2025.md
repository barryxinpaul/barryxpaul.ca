### hi there!

i'm currently in the middle of my summer internship at sherpa°, living in a condo downtown toronto with my friends and finally have some time to write reflect on my sophmore year and what my goals are for the summer. decided to start blogging as a way to keep track of my goals and thoughts so this is more for me than you but thanks for reading lol.

### 2nd year

damn, time flies. I can't believe it's already over. nonetheless, this year was a rollercoaster. rigourous courses (bus2257 & cs2209 are the worst), new friends, big fights, and lots of days in Weldon. 

on the brightside:
- i had a lot of fun with my friends and made a lot of memories getting drunk, high, concerts, and "studying" together
- was invited into mckinsey challenge and attended 2 hackathons (uoft & geese)
- recruited into sherpa° for a software engineering internship and interviewed at 6+ other companies (amazon, ibm, zurich, etc.)
- danced and modelled for caisa fashion show (#sports) and loved my w5 dev, bagel ai, and taw team

but wow, I'm glad it's over

 i really did do a lot this year and i'm proud of it but towards the end of the year i was so burnt out and probably didn't take the best care of myself. it felt like i was always running from one thing to the next and i was never really able to just take a day off. but yknow it was all worth it and i'm ready to not have to care about uni academics next year (hba) and focus on my career, friends, and my health.

### summer 2025

i'm not fully sure what my plans are for the summer yet, tbh i'm just going to chill and enjoy my time. there are some i've been wanting to do (like blogging) and i think i'll try to take this summer to do them so here they are:

#### travel
never been a huge fan of travelling but recently i've been getting the itch to explore more (am i getting old?) so i'm going to try to travel to vancouver and san francisco.

#### blog
i've been meaning to start a blog for a while now but never really got around to it. probably going to try to post once every 2 weeks or so and drop restaurants i've tried, resources for uni/career, and my thoughts on whatever's going on in my life.

#### work
i'm interning at sherpa° this summer and i love it. it's been a perfect blend between creative and technical work and i've been able to learn a lot from it. building out ai related products rn and joining a bunch of meetings.

#### recruitment
can you believe that recruiting for 2026 is already happening? i'm one month into my internship and i'm already thinking about next year. the good news is that it's casing and i've been enjoying that a lot while learning it. thankfully thankfully, i've been blessed with lots of good resources that i'll share in one of my blogs.

#### health
go gym, eat healthy, and sleep more.

#### network
i'm going to try to post on X (twitter) daily or every other day and share my projects, learnings, and thoughts. i'm also going to try to meet more people in the startup world and try to see what it is that i readlly want to do

#### code
build cool stuff. trying to build an app, a SaaS, and a other side projects. goal of 500 commits by september.

anyways, that's pretty much it. hopefully i keep this up.
